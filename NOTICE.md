# Third-party notices

openGym — Copyright (C) 2026 Duarte Santos.
openGym's own code is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3.0** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## App store exception

As an additional permission under section 7 of the AGPL v3.0, the copyright holder permits
distribution of the openGym mobile application through app store platforms (such as the
Apple App Store and Google Play) whose terms of service would otherwise be incompatible
with the AGPL, provided the corresponding source code remains available under the AGPL at
the project repository. This permission applies to the distribution channel only and does
not otherwise limit the license.

## Body diagram geometry

The muscle outlines the body maps are drawn from (`frontend/src/lib/body-paths.js`) are derived
from [**MuscleMap**](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap) by Melih Colpan, used under the
**MIT License** and reproduced below. MuscleMap ships its path data as Swift source rather than
`.svg` files; the paths were converted to a JSON module, its sub-group shapes were dropped, and
nothing else about the artwork was changed.

## Exercise data & media

### OlyGym's catalogue — Catalyst Athletics, and YouTube for the video

The catalogue in this fork (`frontend/src/lib/exercises-data.js`, rebuilt from
`scripts/oly-catalogue/catalyst-exercises.csv` by `scripts/oly-catalogue/build-oly-catalogue.mjs`)
comes from [**Catalyst Athletics**](https://www.catalystathletics.com/exercises/): the exercise
names, movement categories, equipment, muscle tags, descriptions and the demo video of each lift,
taken from their public exercise pages. Their text and their videos are **not** covered by
openGym's AGPL, and every entry cites the page it came from (`src`).

**No media is redistributed by this fork.** Nothing is downloaded: each entry links one YouTube
video, and the app hotlinks that video's poster frame from `img.youtube.com` at runtime
(1280×720 in the exercise detail views, 320×180 in list rows). YouTube's terms permit hotlinking
and embedding but not bulk downloading, so the frames are fetched by the reader's browser and
never stored. The videos themselves belong to Catalyst Athletics.

This fork replaced the dataset openGym upstream used (hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset, redistributing
ExerciseDB v1 with Gym visual media). None of it is fetched, displayed or redistributed here any
more: the compose file has no `media` service, the frontend has no image base to point anywhere,
and the catalogue carries no image or GIF field. It stays in the upstream project, where the
provenance of that media is still a live question — see upstream's NOTICE.md if you go back to it.

Brazilian Portuguese exercise instructions under
`scripts/instruction-sources/pt-BR.json` and exercise names under
`scripts/exercise-name-sources/pt-BR.json` are original translations of that
English source produced with OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude Code
language-model assistance. They are not copied from a separate Portuguese
dataset. Their review status and translation policy are documented alongside
the source files.

## Gym check-in QR codes

The gym check-in feature (a saved membership code shown as a QR code on the phone, added by
typing, importing a photo, or scanning with the camera) uses three third-party packages. All are
permissively licensed and compatible with openGym's AGPL, and all load on demand: the QR renderer
and the browser decoder only when a card is shown or scanned, the ML Kit plugin only in the
Android/iOS app.

### QR/barcode rendering — `lean-qr`

openGym renders each saved code on the phone with [**lean-qr**](https://github.com/davidje13/lean-qr)
by David Evans, used under the **MIT License** and reproduced below. Only the code's stored value
is kept; the picture is generated fresh from that value each time it is shown, never stored.
It runs the same way in the app and in the browser/PWA.

### Camera scan & photo decode in the browser — `jsQR`

In a browser (including the installed PWA), reading a code from the camera or from an imported
photo uses [**jsQR**](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) by Cosmo Wolfe, under the **Apache License
2.0** (text at <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> and in the package's own `LICENSE`).
Where the browser has a native `BarcodeDetector`, that is tried first and jsQR is the fallback.
Video frames are decoded in memory and never uploaded or stored.

### Camera scan & photo decode in the app — `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning`

In the Android/iOS app, reading a code — from the camera or from an imported photo — uses the
[**@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning**](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-mlkit) plugin
by the Capawesome Team (Robin Genz), a Capacitor wrapper around Google's ML Kit, used under the
**Apache License 2.0**. openGym pins the `7.x` line to stay on Capacitor 7. The full license text is
available at <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> and in the package's own `LICENSE` file.
The decoded string is what openGym keeps; the photo itself is never stored.
